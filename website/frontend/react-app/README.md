# Nomos Web Interface Frontend

Authors: Jan Hoffmann and Ankush

This website is based on the template black-dashboard-react
(https://www.creative-tim.com/product/black-dashboard-react).

The template is in turn based on Reactsrap
(https://reactstrap.github.io) and Create React App
(https://create-react-app.dev).

These are the best sources for resolving issues with the installation
(see Create React App) and issues with the look of the page
(Reacstrap). Reacstrap is based on Bootstrap, so that's also a good
resource.

## Installation for Local Development

1. Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/

   The installation has been tested with version NodeJS Version 12.18.
   You also need the npm, which might be part of the installation package.
   However if you install NodeJS with a packet manager you need to run something like

   port install nodejs12
   port install npm6

2. In your terminal, navigate to this directory and run the following.

   npm install
   npm start

   This should open the website in your browser and you can start
   editing.

## Building and Publishing

I have to find out how to do that. Probably with

   npm run build

## CSS

The css files are generated from the scss files that are stored in the
directory src/assents/scss. To generate the css files after modifying
the scss run the command

   npm run map-sass

## Black Dashboard React

This frontend is based on the template black-dashboard-react.
